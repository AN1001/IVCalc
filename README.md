IV Calc is a powerful investment platform calculator
Investment can be tricky at time due to high levels of uncertainty alongside other complex factors. One such factor may be choosing the right platform to hold your investments on, as their charges vary greatly and are often confusing. It's impossible to know with certainty how to get the most out of your money, but using tools like IV Calc it is possible to reach an informed decision.
With IV Calc you can not only compare different investment platforms, but also simulate their use in real time. This is effective against 27 different platforms for both funds and shares.

This website includes line graphs using the library chart.js and is built without any other dependencies or frameworks.
IV Calc also supports 4 wrappers (ISA, JISA, GIA/Direct, SIPP), as well as both shares/stocks and funds as seperate componenents
